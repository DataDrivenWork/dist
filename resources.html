            <a href="https://www.siop.org/" target="_blank">SIOP (Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology)</a> - 
            It would be irresponsible of me if I did not start with the head dog, SIOP. If you have been around this field for any length of time, you have definitely heard of SIOP so I’m not going to go into too many details here. Check out the website. It has some good resources, including information on graduate programs and a job board.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center"> 
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/" target="_blank">I/O Psychology Reddit</a> - 
            This is my go to source to keep up with the field. The site has a little something for everyone, from grad students to working professionals. Highly recommend checking out the Wiki page for another great list of resources.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://discord.gg/Vt7q5Av8" target="_blank">IO and Work Psychology Discord</a> - 
            Discord chat that has all the IO psychology you could ever want and more!
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://discord.gg/qbH7Ghme" target="_blank">IO Psych Coders</a> - 
            Another work psych discord, this one focused on more of the technical aspects of IO. The admin is very active, and the server often has events and projects. Also a great resource for people who enjoy the data science side of work psychology, with plenty of datasets available and a supportive and active community.

            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/03J8m9ao0nVIEq5qUzae1y" target="_blank">Department 12</a> - 
            This is one of those podcasts where even if I don’t think I will be interested in the particular topic, I walk away with a new appreciation for the subject matter. The mark of a great podcast if you ask me. Host Ben Butina is an excellent interviewer and he brings on a fairly wide range of guests. 

        </p>
        <p class="text-center"> 
            <a href="https://directionallycorrectnews.substack.com/" target="_blank">Directionally Correct</a> - 
            Though it is targeted more generally toward people analytics, don’t let Directionally Correct fool you. It is most definitely a work psych podcast. As the latest hit in the field, Cole and Scott have some of the most heralded guests of any such podcast. This is another one of those podcast that is great no matter the topic. I also recommend subscribing to the newsletter by the same name.
        </p>

            <a href="https://thegig.online/" target="_blank">The GIG</a> - 
            I’ll be honest, I haven’t listened to this one as much as I should. That being said, I am a huge fan of both Richard Landers’ and Tara Behrend’s work, who are the co-host for the show, so I know this podcast will not disappoint. From what I have heard, the show keeps things casual, but not careless, which I very much appreciate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7IdVelHZc0MqOzjktXtuiV" target="_blank">The Brando and Joe Podcast</a> - 
            I found this podcast through the IO psych reddit. This podcast is more targeted toward work psychology graduate students and those interested in the field. I find that it provides some unique perspectives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife" target="_blank">WorkLife with Adam Grant</a> - 
            Though he is one of the most polarizing figures in work psychology today, Adam Grant has done an excellent job of connecting with a popular audience. For that alone, his podcast is worth a listen. Not to mention, this is the first work psychology podcast I ever found.

            <a href="https://paulspector.com/" target="_blank">Paul Spector</a> - 
            Paul’s website helped to inspire me to create my own, so just for that I owe him a huge debt of gratitude. Thanks Paul. He doesn’t stop there though. One of my favorite parts of his site is that he shares some great assessments (job satisfaction, turnover intentions, etc…) at absolutely no cost. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://scienceforwork.com/" target="_blank">Science for Work</a> - 
            This website is the first of a few I am going to recommend that summarizes research articles in an easy to read format. Super helpful for practitioners and those who are interested in the field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://www.ioatwork.com/" target="_blank">IO at Work</a> - 
            Another website that summarizes research articles for practitioners. Highly recommend.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://neoacademic.com/" target="_blank">NeoAcademic</a> - 
            Remember how I said I am a big fan of Richard Lander’s work? Well don’t just take my word for it. NeoAcademic is his website and he has some really great articles here that have taught me a lot about the field.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            <a href="https://www.siop.org/" target="_blank">SIOP</a> - 
            Yes, I already plugged SIOP in the communities section. But you should really check out their website.
