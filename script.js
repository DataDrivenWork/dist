So you think goldfish have a 3 second memory? Think again!
Research has in fact shown that goldfish are actually quite capable of remembering things for several months and can even learn some complex tasks, such as pressing a lever to receive food.
Despite these research findings, this myth of the 3 second memory still persists today. Now fortunately, the persistence of this myth is fairly inconsequential, at least for those of us who don’t own goldfish. However, it raises the question
What myths and misconceptions exist in our world today that have no supporting evidence of basis in reality?
A recent study published in Leadership Quarterly, “Zombie Leadership: dead ideas that still walk among us” (Haslam et al., 2023), seeks to expose these myths that persist in the field of leadership. Now unlike my goldfish example, misconceptions in leadership can have fairly significant and potentially dangerous consequences for pretty much everybody. We all have leaders in our lives or are leaders in some capacity, meaning that leadership impacts all of us, regardless of our situation. As a side note, I just want to say that the title of this research article is on my all-time favorite list, and I wish more researchers would follow the authors lead in creatively naming their research. 
In this paper, the authors discuss eight popular leadership myths that stick around without solid research backing them up. They argue these myths linger because they uphold the existing social order and justify those in power—a thought-provoking claim. So, what are these persistent but baseless ideas about leadership? Let’s dive in.
1. Leadership is all about leaders
2. There are specific qualities that all great leaders have
3. There are specific thing that all great leaders do
4. We all know a great leader when we see one
5. All leadership is the same
6. Leadership is a special skill limited to special people
7. Leadership is always good and it is always good for everyone
8. People can’t cope without leaders
I’ll include a handy little graphic from the paper that summarizes these “axioms of leadership” below for those who would like to see the authors’ comments on each. I would love to cover each of these ideas one-by-one as they do in the article, but I do not have time to write all of that and my guess is that you do not want to read all of that, so instead I would like to review 3 of the main themes from these ideas as I see them.

Success Should Be Attributed To Formal Leaders 
Perhaps the most persistent and oldest myth of leadership, with its roots going all the way back to classical literature. We often credit these formal leaders too much for successes and blame them for failures, overlooking the crucial role of their teams or "followers." We can all think of numerous “great people” throughout history who many attribute to having an outsized influence on shaping our world as we know it today. In reality, while formal leaders are important, the success of any group depends heavily on all its members. Research shows that overly praising formal leaders can boost their egos at the expense of their teams, potentially harming overall success. My astute reader will no doubt have noticed I have been careful to say “formal leaders” up to this point. That is because ir is important to recognize “informal leaders”, who play a key leadership role for people on the ground. These unsung heroes provide invaluable guidance and advice to the organization, often solving problems without needing formal authority. This balanced approach can lead to more effective leadership and group success. Taking all of this information together, I believe it is critical to focus our efforts not only on formal leaders, but also on the followers of that leader and the interaction between them. This needs to start by reminding leaders of the importance of their followers for their success
Leaders Have Special Characteristics That Equip Them For Their Roles
This misconception is a little harder to dispel. I think it gives us all comfort to believe those who lead us are in some ways special or have some capability that we ourselves lack, a belief reflected in the growing wage gap between CEOs and average workers—from 20 times more in 1950 to 400 times more today. This disparity is often justified by the idea that leaders have an outsized impact on business productivity. However, this view creates a psychological distance between leaders and their teams, which can limit followers' willingness to correct their leaders and show their own initiative. The truth is, while leaders need to be competent, there's no evidence supporting the need for them to be "special." Effective leadership actually involves engaging in what might seem like mundane tasks—building trust, listening to issues, and fostering a positive work environment. These actions help close the gap between leaders and their teams, making leadership more effective.
All Leadership Is The Same
This one really gets under my skin: the notion that there's a universal, secret formula to leadership that works in every context. This idea is not only overly simplistic but also completely unrealistic. Effective leadership changes with circumstances and evolves over time. Trying to pin down common traits or behaviors among successful leaders usually ends up with a bunch of contradictions. Surprisingly, even intelligence, a strong contender for predicting effective leadership, explains just 4% of the variance. The truth is, leadership effectiveness is highly dependent on the context—strategies that work wonders in one scenario might fail miserably in another. Leaders need to either adapt their methods to fit the specific challenges of their environment. Or another approach might be identifying the right leader for the particular context. 
Stopping The Zombie Apocalypse
I’m not going to sugar coat it. Stemming the tide of zombie leadership is no easy task. These myths linger because they're deeply ingrained, despite lacking solid evidence. But debunking them is crucial for a more complete understanding of leadership and its effects on our work. Haslam et al., 2023 aim to challenge these myths to prevent their harmful effects, such as alienating team members, fostering complacency and narcissism among leaders, and ultimately diminishing group productivity. Moving forward, we need to focus not only on leaders but also on the teams and environments they manage. Leadership is really about managing these relationships effectively and guiding the team toward its goals.  This wider view of leadership can ultimately lead us to a zombie free world.
